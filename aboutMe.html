    <h3>About Me:</h3> 
    
    <p>Though my initial training is not in the tech world, I believe my diverse and varied background gives me a uniquely creative viewpoint on tackling software development challenges. Attending both a music highschool for piano performance and then later graduating with a degree in electronic music composition from <strong>New College of Florida</strong>, my early professional career was spent producing and performing Electronic Dance Music. After living in LA for many years in pursuit of this dream, I achieved many lifelong goals including performing at major music festivals (such as <strong>Coachell</strong> and <strong>EDC Vegas</strong>), having my music released on a major record label <strong>(Big Beat, Atlantic Records)</strong> and having my music licensed to a major television series <strong>(The Ozarks)</strong>. After some time, my desire to take on new and unfamiliar challenges drove me to follow my other passion: brewing. After working in several breweries up and down the west coast from <strong>Trustworthy Brewing</strong> in Burbank, to <strong>MacLeod Ales</strong> ub Van Nyes, to <strong>Reuben's Brews</strong> in Seattle, I eventually ended up at <strong>Modern Times</strong> in Portland. However, after almost 6 years of brewing, my interests have yet again driven me to take on a new challenge and I find myself drawn to the software development world. Though these worlds I have been in seem different on the outside, they are all linked with the dynamic balance of art and science. Each of my careers have required a skillset of both pragmatic engineering skills, counterpointed with the idealistic dreams of an artist. I hope to apply this style of thinking as I move forward with my career as a software developer.</p>
